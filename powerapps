1. Core Components
Overview of PowerApps type (Canvas/Model-Driven) used

Dataverse / database layer – tables, relationships, and audit

Integration components – connectors (standard/custom), APIs, Azure Functions

Automation components – Power Automate flows, approvals

Security components – roles, environment security, DLP policies

Monitoring & logging – App Insights, CoE Kit, audit logs

2. Connectivity & Interdependencies
How PowerApps connects to Dataverse and other data sources

Dependency of flows, plugins, and PCF components on core data

External system integrations (APIs, SharePoint, Outlook, etc.)

Security interdependencies (role-based access tied to components)

Solution layering – dependencies between base, custom, and configuration solutions

3. Development Approach
Environment strategy (Dev / Test / UAT / Prod)

Solution management (managed vs unmanaged solutions)

Componentized development – forms, screens, flows, connectors, PCFs

Coding standards (Power Fx, plugin standards, reusable components)

Testing practices – Test Studio, test data management

4. Deployment Pipelines
CI/CD process overview using Power Platform CLI & Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions

Solution export/import process

Versioning & tagging for builds

Automated data migration and configuration in pipelines

Rollback and validation steps post-deployment
