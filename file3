 hope you are doing well.

After careful consideration and discussions with my close ones, I have decided to resign from my position at [Company Name] due to personal reasons. This was not an easy decision, but I believe it is necessary at this point in my life.

I am truly grateful for the support, opportunities, and guidance I have received during my time here. I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition and will do everything I can to assist during the notice period.

Please let me know how I can help to make the transition as seamless as possible.

Thank you once again for everything.
